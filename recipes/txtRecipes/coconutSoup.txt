directions
Prepare Basic Chicken Stock. Reserve 4-½ cups stock and 2 cups cubed or shredded chicken for the soup. Have fried noodles ready for the accompaniments.
Coarsely chop one of the onion halves; slice the other half thinly and set aside. Put the chopped onion, ginger, garlic and ½ cup stock into a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Put the flour into a bowl. Very slowly whisk in 1 cup broth, mixing thoroughly. Set aside.
Pour oil into a medium pan and set over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add sliced onions and fry, stirring, until they begin to turn brown at the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add cayenne, paprika, turmeric and salt, stirring once. Add remaining 3 cups broth and onion-ginger purée. Pour the flour mixture through a strainer into the pot. Add 1 tablespoon cilantro. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Add some of the hot soup to the coconut milk, then pour it back into the soup. Stir in cooked chicken along with the cooked noodles and simmer very gently on low heat 5 minutes. Watch carefully; if the coconut milk becomes too hot it will curdle. Stir in remaining cilantro.
Serve soup with accompaniments on the side.
