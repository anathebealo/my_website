directions
For the shortcake: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt. Add creams and mix until just combined. Place mixture onto cookie sheet in 6 even blobs. Bake until golden (about 18-20 minutes).
For the whipped cream: Add all ingredients to food processor. Mix until cream is at desired 
texture (about 2 minutes).
For the fruit: mix fruits together in a bowl. Stir in sugar. Best to let this sit for at least an hour before eating as the sugar will pull juices from the fruits.
**Can use any types of fruit you would like -- I just happened to have strawberries and mangos in my kitchen.
