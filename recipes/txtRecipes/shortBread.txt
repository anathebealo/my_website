ingredients
5
1,cup (2 sticks) butter at cool room temperature
1,cup confectioners' sugar
2,tsp vanilla extract
2,cups all-purpose flour
1/2,tsp salt (if using unsalted butter)
directions
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Lightly grease a cookie sheet that has been lined with wax paper.
In a medium sized bowl, mix flour, sugar and vanilla.
Slice butter in tbsp sized pieces, and cut into flour mixture. I find it is easiest to add the butter about 1/6 at a time.
Plop dough onto cookie sheet and flatten with hands or a rolling pin. If the dough is too sticky, cover with a piece of plastic wrap and roll over that. Then remove plastic when it is done.
Poke holes in top of rolled dough with fork to allow excess steam to escape.
Bake until top is light golden brown and edges are a deeper golden brown color. (about 35 minutes)
Once done, remove from pan immediately and put onto cooling rack.
**If you want your cookies to be in shapes, use a cookie cutter on the flattened dough before putting into the oven. You can also score the top of the rolled dough with a knife on the lines on which you want to cut.
