directions
In large pot, melt butter. Then add onion and garlic. Cook until onions are see-through.
Add chicken and cook for 4 minutes.
Stir in 1 chopped jalepeno, the chopped soreno pepper, all spices, worcheshire sauce and tobasco.
Add diced tomatoes. Make sure they are drained (if they aren't, it will take longer to cook the water off).
Add cream of coconut and raisins. 
Cook down until texture is thick (about 1-2 hours depending on how much liquid was in it and how thick you want it to be). Stir occasionally to make sure bottom does not burn.
Add spices to taste (I usually add more curry).
Serve over white rice with desired toppings chopped and put on top.
